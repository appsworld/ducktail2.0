# Ducktail's New Tooling

## Overview

Ducktail, a sophisticated cyber threat actor known for hijacking Facebook Business and Ads accounts, has recently updated its arsenal. This repository contains both the original and decrypted versions of Ducktail's latest C# source code, providing deep insights into the evolving techniques and tactics employed by this actor. The repository includes the version with encrypted values as discovered, its decrypted counterpart for thorough analysis, and the decryption routine used in this process. This new source code is an updated version of the threat actor's infrastructure, representing Ducktail's renewed efforts to expand its infection capabilities and enhance detection evasion techniques.

## Contents

- `SourceCode-Encrypted`: Original, encrypted source code as obtained from the threat actor.
- `SourceCode-Decrypted`: Decrypted version of the source code for clarity and easier analysis.
- `decryption_routine.py`: Decryption routine used to decrypt the threat actor's source code.

## Decryption Routine

The decryption routine in this repository was designed to decrypt obfuscated and encrypted segments of the threat actor's source code. This tool is invaluable for analysts seeking to understand the specific TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) implemented by Ducktail, as well as potential indicators of compromise.
